Encryption Algorithms implemented in C (Caesars Cipher, Affine Cipher, Feistel Cipher, Playfair Cipher)


How to use it:
- clone the project
- cd exercise_1
- make a file "input.txt" and write the message that you want to encrypt
- type "make" and then the the name of the algorithm that you want to use  (e.g.: "make playfair")

Available commands the user can type:
- make otp
- make caesars
- make playfair
- make affine
- make feistel

Each of these commands will use a different algorithm to encrypt the message.
